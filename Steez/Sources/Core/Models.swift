import Foundation

// Note: This file previously contained WardrobeItem, ProductLink, and ImportJob models
// These have been removed as the app currently focuses only on image upload and Google Lens analysis
// If wardrobe functionality is added back in the future, these models can be restored

// Currently no models are needed as all data structures are defined in NetworkService.swift
// (UploadResponseData, LensProduct, etc.)
